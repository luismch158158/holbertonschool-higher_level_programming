# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
This project is about if/else statements and loops and functions

## PROJECTS

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing (file: 0-positive_or_negative.py)
	- Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
1. The last digit (file: 1-last_digit.py)
	-  Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game (file: 2-print_alphabet.py)
	- Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off (file: 3-print_alphabt.py)
	- Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4. Hexadecimal printing (file: 4-print_hexa.py)
	- Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
5. 00...99 (file: 5-print_comb2.py)
	- Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need (file: 6-print_comb3.py)
	- Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
7. islower (file: 7-islower.py)
	- Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
8. To uppercase (file: 8-uppercase.py)
	- Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important (file: 9-print_last_digit.py)
	- Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
10. a + b (file: 10-add.py)
	- Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. a ^ b (file: 11-pow.py)
	- Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
12. Fizz Buzz (file: 12-fizzbuzz.py)
	- Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
13. Insert in sorted linked list (file: 13-insert_number.c, lists.h)
	- Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
