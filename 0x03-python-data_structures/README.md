# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
This project is about Data structures like lists, tuples, tuple packing, sequence unpacking, list comprehensions, etc.

## PROJECTS
0. Print a list of integers (file: 0-print_list_integer.py)
	- Function that prints all integers of a list.
1. Secure access to an element in a list (file: 1-element_at.py)
	- Function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
2. Replace element (file: 2-replace_in_list.py)
	- Function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
3. Print a list of integers... in reverse! (file: 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py)
	- Function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
4. Replace in a copy (file: 4-new_in_list.py)
	- Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
5. Can you C me now? (file: 5-no_c.py)
	- Function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
6. Lists of lists = Matrix (file: 6-print_matrix_integer.py)
	- Function that prints a matrix of integers.
7. Tuples addition (file: 7-add_tuple.py)
	- Function that adds 2 tuples.
8. More returns! (file: 8-multiple_returns.py)
	- Function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
9. Find the max (file: 9-max_integer.py)
	- Function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
10. Only by 2 (file: 10-divisible_by_2.py)
	- Function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
11. Delete at (file: 11-delete_at.py)
	- Function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
12. Switch (file: 12-switch.py)
	- Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b
13. Linked list palindrome (file: 13-is_palindrome.c, lists.h)
	- Function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
